# Chess
 A local two-player Chess game made with JAVA.swing

CONCEPTS USED:              

-Object Oriented Programming           
-JAVA abstract class                
-two-dimensional arrays    
-GUI with mouse-event functionality             
-Importing images

WHAT I LEARNED:

-how to make graphics with JAVA swing                     
-how to use the abstract class to define varied functionality between class members

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:

-online two-player               
-adding 'castling' movement                 
-adding unique pawn movements (switching pieces, 'en passant')            
-bug fix: King's 'check' status doesnt always respond to pawn's possible moves
